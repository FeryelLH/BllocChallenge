Notifications list
When the app has notification access. The user sees their last 20 notifications or an empty state
if none. Notifications are sorted from most to least recent. If the user receives a notification the
list is updated. If they receive a notification while the app is not in the foreground, the next time
they open the app they should see the list. The notification consists of the title, content and app
icon. You can add any other information you see fit.
